# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

As we discussed in class and how form the feedback from last semester: 
The invariant for my application of fibonacci garantees that for the nth iteration the code will return the sum for (n-1) + (n-2), which themselves are sums of the two values before them, unless they equal the base cases of 1 or 0 in which they take the values of 1 and 0 respectively. This is garanteed in my code since it is building up the fibonacci array, this will determine the value to push, by summing up the previous two index values. The sum happens before the recursion is called, garanteeing that by the start of the next recursive call the invariant holds true. Keeping the integrity of the fibonacci number list.
